# Aura Social: The SocialFi

Welcome to the Aura Social, a new Social-Fi platform that combines social media with decentralized finance (DeFi). Aura Social uses a unique metric called Social Score to track an influencer’s online presence by considering things like engagement, follower authenticity, and content quality. This Social Score then converted into Social Score Tokens (SSTs) basically nfts, which can be traded on decentralized marketplaces ( nft secondary marketplaces ). These tokens (nfts) provides a real-time look at an influencer's value, making the influencer-brand relationship more transparent and efficient.

## Features

- **React Frontend**: Utilizes modern React practices including hooks and context for state management, interacting seamlessly with the Django backend through RESTful APIs.
- **Django Backend**: Robust backend architecture with Django REST Framework for API development, handling complex business logic and database operations.
- **Docker Integration**: Simplifies the setup and deployment process with Docker containers for each major component of the application.
- **Secure Authentication**: Includes examples of secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Dynamic Data Interaction**: Demonstrates CRUD operations, search functionalities, and real-time data updates.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and ensure Docker is installed and running.

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose (for managing multi-container setups)
- Git (for version control)

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Build and Run Docker Containers**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

This command builds the images and starts the containers defined in your `docker-compose.yml`. For the initial setup, it might take some time to download and build all necessary Docker images.

### Explore the Application

- **React Frontend**: Access the React application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` on your browser.
- **API Endpoints**: Access the Django API through `http://localhost:8000/api/`.

## Documentation

- **React Components**: Located under `productFrontend/src/`, where you can find all React components and their styling.
